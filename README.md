# landing-page

// This is the first main project of the Odin Project.

// Starting this project felt very stressful, like I didn't know what I was doing. To be fair I didn't really know enough to get this done, but I had so much fun working on this landing page. I know I have a long way to go, but I'm really excited about this journey!
